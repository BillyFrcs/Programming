<h1>Programming Languages</h1>

This repository contains about learning basics or fundamental to advanced with the most Object Oriented Programming Languages in the world.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or forks this repository, then install compiler or sdk to compiled the code. Clone this repo by using the syntax below, then copy and paste on your terminal, make sure that you've already installed <a style = "text-decoration:none;" href = "https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> in your local system.

```
git clone https://github.com/BillyFrcs/ProgrammingLanguages.git
```

2. Visit the link below to download and install the compiler or sdk.

   - [C/C++](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/)

## Data Structures And Algorithms

Implementation data structures and algorithms with C++, please check this <a style = "text-decoration:none;" href = "https://github.com/BillyFrcs/ProgrammingLanguages/tree/master/CPlusPlus/Data%20Structures%20And%20Algorithms">Folder</a> to see all the implementations.

## Coding Challenges

Learning how to solve problem Data Structures and Algorithms with some Programming languages and passed all the problem cases from [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard) website and solve simple coding interview questions.
